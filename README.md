# MRI Brain Tumor Detection: Project Overview



# Resources
**Python Version:** 3.10.9 <br>
**Packages:** NumPy, Matplotlib, JSON, Pandas, Keras backend, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NiBabel, util, public_tests, test_utils



# Data Collection
Data was provided by the [Decathlon 10 Challenge](https://decathlon-10.grand-challenge.org/). 



# EDA
Each of the 484 training samples consists of two files. The first file is an image file containing a 4D array of MR images of a voxel and specifying one of the four sequences: Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery, T1-weighted, T1-weighted with gadolinium contrast enhancement, or T2-weighted. The second file is a 3D array label indicating whether the corresponding voxel is background, edema, non-enhancing tumor, or enhancing tumor.
