# MRI Brain Tumor Detection: Project Overview



# Resources
**Python Version:** 3.10.9 <br>
**Packages:** NumPy, Matplotlib, JSON, Pandas, Keras backend, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NiBabel, util, public_tests, test_utils



# Data Collection
Data was provided by the [ChestX-ray8 dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315) which contains 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients.



# EDA
[A rudimentary Exploratory Data Analysis.](/MRI_CVision_EDA.ipynb) Since plenty of Data Cleaning will be required for image generation, only the labels and class balance were scrutinized. Below is an image of the frequency of pathological conditions among the training, validation, and testing datasets.
